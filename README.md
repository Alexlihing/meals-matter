## MealsMatter
Our submission for Purdue Hello World 2024

## Inspiration
Many restaurants, cafes, and bakeries simply waste surplus food rather than use it to support people suffering from food insecurity. We created MealsMatter to combat this issue and connect potential food providers with those in need.

## What it does
MealsMatter allows food distributors to register accounts in order to join our database, which contains their name and address. People searching for food distributors can use the map page to enter their own location and a radius within with to search for food providers. The website displays options for food distributors that users in need of food can go to for help, forging a connection between local businesses and those in need.

## How we built it
We used HTML for the frontend, Python with Flask for the backend, and Firebase for the database. We used the Google Maps API display a map on the website on the frontend and to calculate distances between locations on the backend. The backend also uses the Firebase API to add registered users to our database.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team was mostly new to website development when starting this project. As a result, it was initially difficult to find a place to start. We weren't sure how to create the backend, what to use for a database, or how to integrate everything together. However, through thorough research, we learned how create and integrate each component of the website. Due to some time constraints as well, it was difficult to develop every feature that we initially imagined.

## What's next for MealsMatter
With more time, we would like to create an account creation system for food recipients as well. This may enable food providers to find shelters needing food for their people, rather than having individuals search for food providers. In addition, we would like to have the map page use geolocation not only to identify their position on the map, but to use it for matching recipients to distributors as well. Lastly, we would like to add more features for account creation, such as logging in with Google, editing existing account information, and adding more fields for account information, such as location and account type.
